/*
    Ps4Ex1: Our robot ran at a speed of 3.5 in/second for 8 seconds

            We know that, distance = speed * time

            Task 1: Create three variables "speed", "time", and "distance"

            Task 2: Store the above data in the variables created in task 1

            Task 3: Calculate the distance our robot travelled and
                    store the data in the variable created in task 1

            Task 4: Print the variables in the terminal
