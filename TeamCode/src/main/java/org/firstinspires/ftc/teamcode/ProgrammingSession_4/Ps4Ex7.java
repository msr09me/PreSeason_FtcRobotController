/*
    Ps4Ex7: We know that Resistance = voltage / current.

            The voltage of our battery was 12.1 and our robot consumed 2.3 current.

            Task 1: Create a function to calculate the resistance

            Task 2: Create and initialize variable to store above data

            Task 3: Create a variable "resistance"

            Task 4: Use the function created in task 1 to calculate resistance and
                     store in the variable created in task 3

            Task 5: Print the result of task 4 in terminal
