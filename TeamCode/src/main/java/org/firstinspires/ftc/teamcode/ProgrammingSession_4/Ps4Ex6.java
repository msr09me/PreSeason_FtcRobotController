    Ps4Ex6: Our data collection team gave us the following data:

                  Motors	  |      Gear Ratio         |    	Torque Constant
              -------------------------------------------------------------------
                              |                         |
                Left Front    |         4.1             |           0.2
                              |                         |
                Left Back     |         4.05            |           0.18
                              |                         |
                Right Front   |         3.75            |           0.21
                              |                         |
                Right Back    |         4.15            |           0.17


            We also learn the following equations:

                        motor speed = wheel speed * gear ratio
                        motor angular velocity = motor speed * 0.1047
                        motor torque = torque constant * current
                        motor power = motor torque * motor angular velocity

            During the data collection, the wheel speed was 3 and current was 1.3

            Task 1: Create and initialize variables to store the above table's data

            Task 2: Create and initialize 2 variables to store the wheel speed and current data

            Task 3: Create a function to calculate motor power

            Task 4: Create 4 variables for motor power for all 4 motors

            Task 5: Calculate motor power for all 4 motors

            Task 6: Print the motor power of each motor in the terminal
