/*
    Ps4Ex4: In exercise Ps4Ex2, the motor angular velocity was 12.30225.

            We know that,
                            motor torque = torque constant * current

                            motor power = motor torque * motor angular velocity

            We found the torque constant for the left front motor is 0.02.
            And current was 0.9 ampere.

            Task 1: Create and initialize variables to store above information

            Task 2: Calculate the motor power

            Task 3: Print the result of task 2 in terminal
