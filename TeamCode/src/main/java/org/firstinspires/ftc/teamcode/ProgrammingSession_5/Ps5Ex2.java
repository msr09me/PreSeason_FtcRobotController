/*
    Ps5Ex1: We know that motor output power = torque * angular velocity
            During the last run, when the torque was 10.9 N-m, angular velocity was 0.81 rad/s
                                 when the torque was 11.3 N-m, angular velocity was 0.87 rad/s

            Task 1: Create a function to calculate motor output power
            Task 2: Create and initialize variables to store above data
            Task 3: Calculate the motor output power using the function created in task 1
            Task 4: Print the result of task 3 in the terminal
