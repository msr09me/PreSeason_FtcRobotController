    Ps4Ex3: We know that,
                            wheel speed = distance / time
                            motor speed = wheel speed * gear ratio
                            motor angular velocity = motor speed * 0.1047

             We ran our robot again for 10 seconds. It travelled 135 inches.

             Because of efficient power distribution,
                we use different gear ratio in four wheel motors as following -

             Front left wheel motor = 4
             Front right wheel motor = 3.75
             Back left wheel motor = 4.05
             Back right wheel motor = 4.15

             Task 1: Create and initialize 4 variables to store gear ratio of 4 wheel motors

             Task 2: Create 4 variables for 4 wheel motor speed

             Task 3: Create 4 variables for 4 wheel motor angular velocity

             Task 4: Create and initialize 3 variables for wheel speed, distance, and time

             Task 5: Calculate motor angular velocity of 4 wheel motors

             Task 6: Print the result of task 5 in the terminal
