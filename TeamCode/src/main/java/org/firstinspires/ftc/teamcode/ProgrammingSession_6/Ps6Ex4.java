/*
    Ps6Ex4: We know that Resistance = voltage / current.

            The voltage of our battery was 12.1 and our robot consumed 2.3 current.

            Part 1: Creating class

                    Task 1: Create a class "MyDcMotor3"

                    Task 2: Create three fields "voltage", "current", and "resistance"

                    Task 3: Create a method to calculate resistance

             Part 2: Using the class

                Task 1: Create an object from MyDcMotor3 class

                Task 2: Store the data into the field

                Task 3:  Use the method created in part 1 task 3 to calculate resistance

                Task 4: Print the result of task 3 in terminal
